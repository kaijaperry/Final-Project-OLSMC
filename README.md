# Final-Project-OLSMC
Kaija Perry's final project for Introduction To Computer Programming.

Week 7 Ideas:
The idea is that you input a chord symbol (example: CMaj7) and the 
individual notes are displayed (C, E, G, B).. This would go for all 
types of 7th chords. As there are so many different types, I sometimes 
have a hard time keeping them straight. There will be an entry box
where you can enter the chord note that you want (C, C#, Db, etc.) 
and then there will be multiple buttons to click what type of 7th 
chord you want (major, minor, dominant, diminished, half-diminished, 
sustained, and minor(Major)).

I will have to use a bit of HTML and CSS to make it appealing :).
Of course, most of the code will be written in Javascript. The idea 
is to have it translate the intervals, so that I won't have to write 
each type of chord for each note (CMaj7, DMaj7, EMaj7, etc). Instead,
it will run through the intervals and give the corresponding notes..

Week 8 Ideas:
I will not be creating a database for my final project. The reason for 
that is because I will not be storing any new data. I will be calculating 
an input rather than storing the input or the results of that input. I 
think that using arrays might be the best way to go for this 
particular project..

I have decided to go with the button option I mentioned last week. I 
will have a place for the user to type their input, then there will be 
a multitude of buttons to decided what type of seventh chord you want. 
When clicked the correct notes will come out (example: “C, E, G, B”).
